## Saurian Translator

This application will take an input from the user, and then translate it to/from the fictional language Saurian. The application has the ability to partially identify proper nouns, and will eventually have the ability to let the user identify proper nouns.

The Saurian language comes from a video game called Star Fox Adventures. A language created to be spoken by the inhabitants of an all-dinosaur planet simply called Dinosaur Planet.

The language itself is a simple cipher language with the following translation rules:

#### A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z English  
#### U R S T O V W X A Z B C M D E F G H J K I L N P 0 Q Saurian

- Numbers, punctiation marks, proper nounns, and symbols are not translated.
- The letter Y does not exist so in thr programming itself it is translated to 0/1, but in the text translation it will be shown as o(0) and O(1).

This project was initially assigned to me in my first coding class a few years ago and it wasnt all that efficient. I have since then learned Data Structures and Algorithms, so I decided to update the code to be more efficient.
