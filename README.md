## This is a simple translator to convert text to and from the fictional language Saurian. 

Saurian is a cipher language created for the video game "Star Fox Adventures" spoken by the natives of an all-dinosaur planet. 

This project was initially assigned to me in my first coding class a few years ago and it wasnt all that efficient. I have since then learned Data Structures and Algorithms, so I decided to update the code to be more efficient. This code will likely be updated to have more functionality and better efficiency as I continue to learn.
